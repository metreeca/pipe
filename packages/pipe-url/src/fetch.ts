/**
 * Creates a resource fetcher.
 *
 * The generated task converts a feed of requests into a feed of
 * {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Response Response} objects, so that a consumer draws on remote and
 * local resources through the client the execution supplies rather than through one of its own.
 *
 * A request is given as the standard `fetch()` function accepts it, that is as a URL string, a
 * {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/URL URL} object or a
 * {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Request Request} object. A response is emitted as soon as its head
 * is received, with the body left unread for the consumer to draw or discard; a response carrying no body is emitted
 * all the same.
 *
 * Exchanges are routed through the fetch client of the {@link @metreeca/gear!index.executor execution} enclosing the
 * call to this factory, so the transport is chosen by the job rather than by the task. Binding {@link createFetch}
 * routes every exchange through a throttled, cached or stubbed client without altering the task. An execution with no
 * binding falls back on the standard `fetch` function.
 *
 * Exchanges are sent with desktop browser `User-Agent` and `Accept` fields. Sites that serve unattended clients
 * differently, or refuse them altogether, are thus scraped as a browser would be. A request that already states one of
 * these fields keeps its own value, as do the values stated by `middlewares`.
 *
 * Content coding is negotiated by the fetch client, which decodes response bodies before they reach the consumer. The
 * task states no `Accept-Encoding` field of its own.
 *
 * Every exchange is logged as it is performed, so a run leaves a trace of the resources it drew on and of the ones it
 * was denied. Requests are logged as stated, before `middlewares` can alter them.
 *
 * > [!NOTE]
 * >
 * > - **Incremental**: each response is emitted as soon as its head is received, so the feed produced runs dry when
 * >   the source does, and an endless source is read for as long as the feed is consumed.
 * > - **Streaming**: responses are drawn one at a time and handed over with the body unread, none retained, so
 * >   resources of any size are handled without holding them in memory, as long as each body is read or cancelled
 * >   before the next response is drawn.
 * > - **Stateless**: the task keeps no state across requests, so the outcome is unaffected by how the feed is split
 * >   across nested feeds or runs; any state carried across exchanges belongs to `middlewares` and the fetch client.
 *
 * > [!WARNING]
 * >
 * > A request stating a URL that is not absolute, or malformed in any other way, is dropped before it is sent, as is
 * > a response stating an unsuccessful status; both are reported to the log, leaving the feed to run to completion.
 *
 * @param middlewares The middlewares to be layered over the fetch client, in request processing order
 *
 * @returns A task converting a feed of requests into a feed of responses
 *
 * @throws {@link !Error Error} If no execution is running, as the fetch client is resolved when the task is created
 *
 * @throws {@link !Error Error} While the feed is consumed, whatever the source reports while producing requests, or
